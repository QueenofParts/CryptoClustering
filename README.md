# CryptoClustering
Module 11 Challenge



# Module 11 Challenge Instructions and Rubric:

Due: Jan 25 at 11:59pm
Calendar	Bootcamp: OSU-VIRT-AI-PT-10-2023-U-LOLC-MWTH
Details	
In this Challenge, you’ll apply your understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, you will examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called CryptoClustering. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Push your changes to GitHub.

Instructions
Rename the Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb file as Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.

Load the crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame and set the index to the “coin_id” column.

Get the summary statistics to see what the data looks like before proceeding.

Prepare the Data
Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

The first five rows of the scaled DataFrame should appear as follows:

The first five rows of the scaled DataFrame.
Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
Use the elbow method to find the best value for k by completing the following steps:

Create a list with the number of k values from 1 to 11.
Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
Create a for loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k.
Create a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve.
Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.
Answer the following question in your notebook: What is the best value for k?
Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using the Original Scaled Data
Use the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data:

Initialize the K-means model with the best value for k.
Create an instance of K-means, define the number of clusters based on the best value of k, and then fit the model using the original scaled DataFrame.
Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the original scaled DataFrame.
Create a copy of the original data and add a new column with the predicted clusters.
Create a scatterplot using pandas’ plot as follows:
Set the x-axis as "price_change_percentage_24h" and the y-axis as "price_change_percentage_7d".
Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.

Retrieve the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component and then answer the following question in your notebook:

What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?
Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

The first five rows of the PCA DataFrame should appear as follows:

The first five rows of the PCA DataFrame.
Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for k using the following steps:

Create a list with the number of k-values from 1 to 11.
Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
Create a for loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k.
Create a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve.
Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.
Answer the following questions in your notebook:
What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?
Does it differ from the best k-value found using the original data?
Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using the PCA Data
Use the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the PCA data:

Initialize the K-means model with the best value for k.
Create an instance of K-means, define the number of clusters based on the best value of k, and then fit the model using the PCA data.
Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data.
Create a copy of the DataFrame with the PCA data and add a new column to store the predicted clusters.
Create a scatte rplot using pandas’ plot as follows:
Set the x-axis as "PC1" and the y-axis as "PC2".
Answer the following question:
What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
Determine the Weights of Each Feature on Each Principal Component
Create a DataFrame that shows the weights of each feature (column) for each principal component by using the columns from the original scaled DataFrame as the index.

Which features have the strongest positive or negative influence on each component?

important
It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.

If you are struggling with a challenge assignment or any aspect of the academic curriculum, please remember that there are student support services available for you:

Ask the class Slack channel/peer support.

AskBCS Learning Assistants exists in your class Slack application.

Office hours facilitated by your instructional staff before and after each class session.

Tutoring Guidelines - schedule a tutor session in the Tutor Sessions section of Bootcampspot - Canvas

If the above resources are not applicable and you have a need, please reach out to a member of your instructional team, your Student Success Advisor, or submit a support ticket in the Student Support section of your BCS application.
